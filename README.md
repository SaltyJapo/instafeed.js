Instafeed.js is a simple way to display your Instagram photos on your website.

See our documentation at [instafeedjs.com](https://instafeedjs.com) or the [docs folder](./docs) for more information.

## Hosted Alternative

When I originally wrote Instafeed.js in 2012, I wanted to create an easy way to quickly add your Instagram photos to your website. I like to think I was able to do that, in large part thanks to the public API Instagram had at the time.

Unfortunately, Facebook has made this process a lot more complex than it used to be. The largest problem is that managing API tokens now requires a server-side component, which I canâ€™t provide through Instafeed.js alone.

If you're looking for a turnkey solution that manages tokens for you, or you need more advanced features like hashtag feeds, I recommend looking at [Behold](https://behold.so). It's a paid service, but it has a free tier that will work for smaller projects.
